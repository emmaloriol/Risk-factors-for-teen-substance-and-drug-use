# Risk-factors-for-teen-substance-and-drug-use
In this project, I use the 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health to build decision tree models to predict health and substance use of teens in the United States. This analysis helped to untangle the many social, home, and environmental factors that influence the complex issues of teen health and drug use. 

The models are built using decision tree methods to create categorization and regression models. The first model predicts categorization of ‘history of cigarette use’ vs ‘no history of cigarette use’ using a decision tree model with pruning. The second model predicts classification of self-reported overall health status (“Excellent”, “Very good”, “Good”, “Poor”) using a random forest decision tree model. The third model uses a boosting decision tree method to produce a regression plot predicting age of first use of alcohol.
